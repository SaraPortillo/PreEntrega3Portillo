                <p> Emma, runner: I've been running for two years. I used to only run 1 or 2 kilometres, but now I run approximately 10. My speed is also improving. In Brighton, I've joined a jogging club. I had never met any of the members before, but now I consider them my friends. When my father was younger, he was a good runner who was quite fit, but he stopped after injuring his knee. In fact, I need to order a new pair of running shoes which will be just a simple pair. I don't believe that the more expensive ones help you run faster!</p>

                <p>Do you skip breakfast? Millions of people do, and if you are one of them, you are putting your ability to think and learn at risk. Skipping breakfast can cause you to be hungry, tired, or grumpy by the middle of the morning. Why is that? First, when you wake up, you have not eaten for about eight hours. Your body’s fuel, called glucose, is low. Eating breakfast raises the level of glucose in your brain. Your brain requires a constant flow of glucose to do mental work.</p>

                <p>What are your bad habits? I think everyone has bad habits. Not everyone agrees on what bad habits are. Some smokers don’t think smoking is a bad habit. Young people don’t think listening to loud music on the train is a bad habit. In Japan, slurping your noodles is a sign that you enjoy your food, but making a noise while eating in England is not good. Have you ever tried to break your bad habits? I have quit smoking and have stopped leaving things laying around the house. I wish other people would stop their bad habits. I get annoyed when people are late for meetings or talk loudly on their phones in public. I also think many motorists need to think about their driving habits. Perhaps I should point out their bad habits.</p>

                <p>Meditation can be better at relieving pain than the best pain-relieving drugs, according to a new report published in the Journal of Neuroscience. The study into the effects of the mind and pain was led by Dr Fadel Zeidan in the USA. The research looked at a technique called “focused attention,” which is a form of meditation where people focus their thoughts only on their breathing. Dr Zeidan said: “This is the first study to show that only a little over an hour of meditation training can dramatically reduce both the experience of pain and pain-related brain activation”. Zeidan added: “We found a big effect - about a 40 per cent reduction in pain intensity and a 57 per cent reduction in pain unpleasantness.”</p>

                <p>Friendship is central to everyone's life. I've found over the years that students are always happy to speak about their friends. An added bonus is that speaking about friends requires students to speak in the third person — always useful practice for the dreaded 's' in the present simple. Discussing work or conversations about love can be fruitful, but if there are problems at work or at home, students might not want to discuss these popular topics. Friendship, on the other hand, always provides good stories.</p>

                <p>A significant amount of research indicates that multi-tasking does not improve efficiency and actually negatively affects results (Junco, 2012).In order to study smarter, not harder, you will need to eliminate distractions during your study sessions. Social media, web browsing, game playing, texting, etc. will severely affect the intensity of your study sessions if you allow them! Research is clear that multi-tasking (e.g., responding to texts, while studying), increases the amount of time needed to learn material and decreases the quality of the learning (Junco, 2012).</p>
